@Breedlove22 @benmezrich The thing we call money is just an information system for labor allocation. What actually matters is making goods &amp; providing services. We should look at currencies from an information theory standpoint. Whichever has least error &amp; latency will win.,2021-01-15T07:12:06.000Z

@PPathole @engineers_feed Yes  that would be the best way to do it. A large solar field or reactor is needed for power  and then some ice mining droids or long maneuvering drills are needed for the H2O. These are probably the trickier bits.,2021-01-09T10:50:47.000Z

@engineers_feed Indirectly  an electric rocket is possible by using electricity to convert CO2+H2O ‚Äî&gt; CH4+O2. This will be needed on Mars even for early missions &amp; Earth too over time.,2021-01-07T22:30:35.000Z
