@Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Merlin is a strong local maximum design  but kerosene is suboptimal fuel  no matter what you do. What matters is cost per ton to Mars. CH4 is the only choice imo.

@RationalEtienne @ryaneshea Just spoke directly to a testing lab. Their main PCR search is for the N1 gene  unique to cov2. N3 is also sought  but is generic to other sars viruses.

@ryaneshea Possible explanation for the dramatic decline in cold &amp; flu prevalence vs prior years.

@ryaneshea Moreover  lower the true prevalence  the higher the false positive number will be. This sounds obvious  but it could mean a very high false positive percentage if true prevalence is low.,2020-11-13T19:25:10.000Z

@PPathole @cleantechnica A good PCR test should identify if I have the cov2 spike proteins  although I have heard some low accuracy numbers for those too. Hard to get a straight answer.

@KlotzAdam @NASASpaceflight @Erdayastronaut Understanding exactly how the body flaps control pitch  yaw &amp; roll during descent  such that the ship is positioned well to relight  flip &amp; land  would be a big win,2020-10-31T22:03:59.000Z

@NASASpaceflight @Erdayastronaut Stable  controlled descent with body flaps would be great. Transferring propellant feed from main to header tanks &amp; relight would be a major win.,2020-10-31T21:59:44.000Z

@PPathole @Erdayastronaut @dauqhx @universal_sci Mars is easier than the moon for propellant production. Could get going with only one ship  where the ship itself is the propellant plant. Needs to make ~2 tons/day.,2020-08-26T02:45:55.000Z
@Erdayastronaut @dauqhx @universal_sci Starship propellant is ~78% oxygen  so an O2 plant on the moon would be enough. Otherwise  we could brute-force it with tankers to low Earth orbit. That‚Äôs probably faster.,2020-08-26T01:05:15.000Z

@kimbal We‚Äôre seeing field false positives much higher than lab false positives  in range of 5% to 10%.

@CDCgov Close contact family gatherings that mix young kids  who have almost no risk of C19 death  with grandparents who have high risk (especially those with prior lung damage)  are one of the most powerful mortality vectors,2020-03-22T14:31:50.000Z

@SamTalksTesla @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @NateSilver538 Sigmoid (S-curve) is how all physical and mental viruses behave  regardless of containment. Containment reduces asymptote of S-curve.

@Lauren62515251 @PPathole @NateSilver538 Fair point :),2020-03-21T16:05:11.000Z
@RiccitelliDylan @ColdBuschLights @PPathole @NateSilver538 Exactly  both would be false positive. Also  dying with C19 is different from dying because of C19. Vast majority who died had other illnesses too. https://t.co/YKMW54q2kL,2020-03-21T15:58:19.000Z
@PPathole @NateSilver538 Up to 80% false positive,2020-03-21T15:17:41.000Z
@PPathole @NateSilver538 Sure  although ventilator companies definitely know how to make ventilators. Just a spike in demand right now. Also  using CPAP machines for less severe cases &amp; using one ventilator for several patients seem like good moves to meet short-term demand.,2020-03-21T15:14:41.000Z
@NateSilver538 Do you have data on the false positive rate? I‚Äôve heard a wide range of numbers. CDC numbers are almost an order of magnitude lower between high fidelity data (onset date known) and ‚Äúpresumed positive‚Äù. https://t.co/vZ3PbhQihG,2020-03-21T15:09:07.000Z

@flcnhvy Anyone feeling even slightly ill should stay home. Elderly should avoid close contact  even with family members  for now. Those seem most important.,2020-03-19T22:35:51.000Z

@RationalEtienne @PPathole Kids are essentially immune  but elderly with existing conditions are vulnerable. Family gatherings with close contact between kids &amp; grandparents probably most risky.,2020-03-19T21:55:03.000Z
@PPathole Based on current trends  probably close to zero new cases in US too by end of April,2020-03-19T21:38:57.000Z

@NateSilver538 Tesla makes cars with sophisticated hvac systems. SpaceX makes spacecraft with life support systems. Ventilators are not difficult  but cannot be produced instantly. Which hospitals have these shortages you speak of right now?,2020-03-19T04:16:37.000Z
